Quick Start:

1. Drag and drop the  prefab from Lune/RetroRenderer/Prefabs into your scene
2. Disable any other cameras already in the scene
3. In the contained Post Process Volume on the prefab, play with the values of VHS Effect and 
Pixelation Effect and you're good to go!
4. See documentation (https://www.luneinteractive.com/vhs-effects-documentation) for a more in depth guide on each effect and its variables


Alternatively:

Add the desired custom Post Process effect to your pre-existing Post Process volumes



Enjoy!
